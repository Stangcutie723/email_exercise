email_exercise

What is it:
A starter app in sending and recieving emails from and to my future applications. It also has testing implemented. 

What did I use: Ruby, Rails, including: Mailer Generator, Some Scaffolding. 

What was it for:
Initially this was my example to get used to using heroku, postgresql, and working with add ons. 
I got to play around with scaffold again and using the rails generator as well. 
I was hoping to use this experience as a way to improve my skills for the app a day called help-desk.
